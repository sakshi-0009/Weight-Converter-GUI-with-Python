# Weight-Converter-GUI-with-Python

__Project : Weight Converter GUI with Python__

Weight conversion means to multiply the value of a unit with the standard conversion value.
In this project, I will take you through how to create a weight converter GUI with Python programming language.
I will use the Tkinter library in Python for this project :

__The standard weight conversion values include:__

1. 1 milligram = 0.001 gram
2. 1 centigram = 0.01 gram
3. 1 decigram = 0.1 gram
4. 1 kilogram = 1000 grams
5. 1 gram = 1000 milligrams
6. 1 ton = 2000 pounds
7. 1 pound = 16 ounces
